# goWhere Mobile Application

## Level of Achievement

Apollo

## Motivation

You’re about to have an outing with your usual group of friends, but even after discussing for hours, nobody seems to come to a conclusion on where to meet up. Some of them preferred going to new and uncommon places, while others wanted to meet up at convenient locations near them. Does this scenario sound familiar to you?

## User Stories

1. As a member of a picky group of friends who can never decide on a location to have an outing at.

2. As a group of friends who would like to explore Singapore, but always decide on meetups at the same location for convenience.

3. As a large group of friends who are each located at different parts of Singapore, and are unable to choose a location equidistant from everybody.

4. As a group of friends who prefer to frequent less crowded areas in Singapore to skip the queues.

5. As a group of friends who only frequent places with high ratings to meet their high standards.

## Project Scope and Ideation

Mobile Application Development using React Native and Firebase.

goWhere decides on preferred location for an outing within a clique. Preferred location can be based on distance from members of the clique, crowd and rating levels, as well as the travel log of the clique. Users can create accounts for their cliques and personalise them by adding home or work locations of each member, as well as their travel log as a clique.

## Tech Stack

For our tech stack, we have decided to use MERN Stack to develop our application.

### React Native

We have chosen to use React Native, an open-source mobile application framework, to develop our frontend. With React Native around for many years, we believe React Native allows us to access an abundance of libraries and community support. Libraries include Native Base and React Navigation.

### NodeJS

We have chosen to use NodeJS as it runs single-threaded and is asynchronously programmed, making this an efficient choice.

### MongoDB

MongoDB is an open-source, document-based database. It stores data in JSON-like documents, ensuring flexible yet highly diverse data availability.

### ExpressJS

We have chosen ExpressJS due to the fast and minimalist web framework used for NodeJS.
