## Motivation

You’re about to have an outing with your usual group of friends, but even after hours of discussion, nobody seems to come to a conclusion on where to meet up. Some of them preferred going to new and uncommon places, while others wanted to meet up at convenient locations near them. Does this scenario sound familiar to you?

## User Stories

1. As someone who has a picky group of friends who can never decide on a location to have an outing at.

2. As someone who frequently have outings with the same group of friends but can never decide on a new location.

3. As someone who have a large group of friends located at different parts of Singapore, but are unable to choose a location equidistant from everybody.

4. As a group of friends who prefers to frequent less crowded places in Singapore.

5. As a group of friends who wants to visit places with high rating levels.

## Project Scope and Ideation

Mobile Application Development using React Native and Firebase.

goWhere decides on preferred location for an outing within a clique. Preferred location can be based on distance from members of the clique, crowd and rating levels, as well as the travel log of the clique. Users can create accounts for their cliques and personalise them by adding home or work locations of each member, as well as their travel log as a clique.
